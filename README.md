Project for the c0met jailbreak. 
This jailbreak is an open source project.

# What now?
I guess you can modify it to add the exploit if you feel like it

# DOESN"T WORK
An expose on c0met,
It is fake, I built it from the latest fork
the JB doesn't work

# Disclaimer
It probably won't work,
I just patched what I would from the fork then cross compiled on linux
